HERON Analytics Tutorial Topics
- Brainstorm meeting between Steve Simon, Xing Song, and Mei Liu on 2018-05-10

----------------------------------
Basic Analytics for Beginners
----------------------------------
Data extraction topics for beginners:
-  How to connect to an oracle database and count the number of unique patients with SQL
-  How to pull patient diagnostic codes and with date restrictions with SQL
-  Simple coding examples like “Hello World”
-  Documentation on the meta-data. For example, what is a concept_path? What do you need it for? This is essential for hypothesis driven research where researchers need specific concepts to describe their cohorts.
-  How to transform long-skinny data to sparse matrix format for R analysis

Programming Language for beginners:
-  R, SAS, Python, SQL
-  What is each language good for?

----------------------------------
Advanced Analytics
----------------------------------
Data Mining and direct access to full database allow us to do complex analyses with case studies such as breast cancer, acute kidney injury, diabetic kidney disease, and sepsis.

Each case study would contain the following modules:
-  Cohort construction using SQL with direct access to database
-  EMR data extraction for the cohort in R
-  Data dictionary creation for use in cohort characterization, data curation, and etc.
-  Data cleaning
-  Validation experiment set up, for example random sampling for cross validation.
-  Modeling with machine learning models

Cluster at KU Center for Research Computing:
-  What is it?
-  Why use it?
-  How to use?

Potential Testers for the Tutorial
----------------------------------
-  Informatics background -> Computer Science / Bioengineering faculty and students at KU-Lawrence
-  Medical background -> KUMC students working on projects using HERON
