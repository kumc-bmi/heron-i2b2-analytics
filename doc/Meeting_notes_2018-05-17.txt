Requirements for analytic environment for CTSA 
- Meeting with Steve on 2018-05-17

----------------------------
Hardware
----------------------------
-  Have ordered hardware for the new server, the old server will be repurposed as the new analytic server

Question: When will the old server become available as the new analytic server?


----------------------------
Software Configurations
----------------------------
First step: key software include 
-  Python
-  Java
-  R
-  RStudio that can run multiple sessions for one user
-  LaTeX within RStudio environment for producing slide shows, technical papers, etc.

Next step: installation of SAS, however questions are:
-  How to configure SAS for access to Oracle, system engineer question?
-  Will there be a licensing issue on a different server with multiple users?

Future: 
-  Do we need to configure tools like Spark? Steve’s guess is no, but need to put it down to see what others think.
