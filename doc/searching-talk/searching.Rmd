## Abstract

Navigating through an electronic health record database can be daunting. Here are a few tips illustrated by a search for records associated with the drug Tamoxifen.

## i2b2 Query & Analysis Tool

<div class="notes">

The query and analysis tool that comes with i2b2 is a nice starting point. Here is what the upper left panel of the opening screen looks like. At this point, you could open the

At this point, you could open the Medications folder and wander around until you find Tamoxifen.

You could use the search function, but be careful. Tamoxifen appears in a lot of strange places, such as under medication allergies.

You can shorten the list substantially by restricting the search to entries within the Medicaiton category.

Notice that each of these Tamoxifen entries is a folder, with other folders within them. You can shorten the list substantially by restricting the search to entries within the Medication category.

## Searching via metadata

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr, quietly=TRUE)
library(knitr, quietly=TRUE)
library(magrittr, quietly=TRUE)
library(ROracle, quietly=TRUE)
cdm_config <- read.csv('../../cdm_config.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
c_connect <-
  dbConnect(Oracle(), cdm_config$account, cdm_config$password, cdm_config$access)
```

You can find Tamoxifen entries by searching the concept_dimension table.

## Searching via metadata

```{r concept_dimension}
sql1 <- "
SELECT concept_cd
FROM blueherondata.concept_dimension
WHERE concept_path LIKE '%Tamoxifen%'"

db1 <- dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql1)
names(db1) <- tolower(names(db1))
dim(db1)
```

## Here's what the first ten data values look like.


```{r print-1}
head(db1, n=10)
```

## Restricting your search

Note the LOINC prefixes, which represent laboratory test values. You might be okay with these, but if not, then you can restrict the search.

```{r concept_dimension-restricted}
sql2 <- "
SELECT concept_cd FROM blueherondata.concept_dimension
WHERE concept_path LIKE '\\i2b2\\Medications%Tamoxifen%'"

db2 <- dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql2)
names(db2) <- tolower(names(db2))
dim(db2)
```

## Here's what the first ten data values look like.

```{r print-2, echo=FALSE}
head(db2, n=10)
```

## The search is case specific, so look for all caps and all lower case.

```{r case-search}
sql3a <- "
SELECT COUNT(concept_cd) FROM blueherondata.concept_dimension
WHERE concept_path LIKE '\\i2b2\\Medications%TAMOXIFEN%'"

dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql3a)

sql3b <- "
SELECT COUNT(concept_cd) FROM blueherondata.concept_dimension
WHERE concept_path LIKE '\\i2b2\\Medications%Tamoxifen%'"

dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql3b)

sql3c <- "
SELECT COUNT(concept_cd) FROM blueherondata.concept_dimension
WHERE concept_path LIKE '\\i2b2\\Medications%tamoxifen%'"

dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql3c)
```

## Notice that the search finds cases where trade names are used instead of Tamoxifen

```{r name_char}
sql4 <- "
SELECT name_char FROM blueherondata.concept_dimension
WHERE
  (concept_path LIKE '\\i2b2\\Medications%tamoxifen%' OR
   concept_path LIKE '\\i2b2\\Medications%Tamoxifen%' OR
   concept_path LIKE '\\i2b2\\Medications%TAMOXIFEN%') AND 
  (name_char NOT LIKE '%tamoxifen%' AND
   name_char NOT LIKE '%Tamoxifen%' AND
   name_char NOT LIKE '%TAMOXIFEN%')"

db4 <- dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql4)
names(db4) <- tolower(names(db4))
dim(db4)
```

## Here are some examples

```{r print-4}
head(db4, n=10)
```
