## Abstract

Patients will have multiple interactions with health care providers. To help distinguish what happens at the same time and at different times, the i2b2 system tracks specific encounters. Let's explore what an encounter means and how you can use this information.

## i2b2 schema

![](~/heron-i2b2-analytics/doc/searching-talk/images/i2b2-schema.jpg)

<div class="notes">

This is the database schema for i2b2.

</div>

## What does the encounter table look like?

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr, quietly=TRUE, warn.conflicts=FALSE)
library(knitr, quietly=TRUE)
library(magrittr, quietly=TRUE)
library(ROracle, quietly=TRUE)
cdm_config <- read.csv('../../cdm_config_b2.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
c_connect <-
  dbConnect(Oracle(), cdm_config$account, cdm_config$password, cdm_config$access)
```

```{r visit-dimension, echo=FALSE}
sql1 <- "
SELECT *
FROM blueherondata.visit_dimension
WHERE ROWNUM < 3"

dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql1)
```

<div class="notes">

Here are the first few rows of the visit dimension table.

</div>

## Counting encounters

```{r count-encounters, echo=FALSE}
sql2 <- "
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT encounter_num)
FROM blueherondata.visit_dimension"

dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql2) %>% format(big.mark=",")
```

<div class="notes">

There are lots of encounters.

</div>

## Encounters in observation_fact table

```{r encounters-in-observation_fact, echo=FALSE}
sql3 <- "
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT encounter_num)
FROM blueherondata.observation_fact"

dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql3) %>% format(big.mark=",")
```

<div class="notes">

Each record in observation fact has a link to visit_dimension.

</div>

## Encounters in observation_fact table

```{r average-encounters-per-patient, echo=FALSE}
sql4 <- "
SELECT AVG(N) FROM (
  SELECT patient_num, COUNT(DISTINCT encounter_num) AS N
  FROM blueherondata.observation_fact
  WHERE patient_num in (
    SELECT DISTINCT patient_num
    FROM blueherondata.observation_fact
    WHERE 
      concept_cd='ICD10:E10.10')
  GROUP BY patient_num)"

dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql4)
```

<div class="notes">

The average number of encounters per patient is small.

</div>

## Encounters in observation_fact table

```{r maximum-encounters-per-patient, echo=FALSE}
sql5 <- "
SELECT MAX(N) FROM (
  SELECT patient_num, COUNT(DISTINCT encounter_num) AS N
  FROM blueherondata.observation_fact
  WHERE patient_num in (
    SELECT DISTINCT patient_num
    FROM blueherondata.observation_fact
    WHERE
      concept_cd='ICD10:E10.10')
  GROUP BY patient_num)"

dbGetQuery(c_connect, sql5)
```

<div class="notes">

But the maximum number can be quite large.

</div>
