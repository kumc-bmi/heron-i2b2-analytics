open_oracle.Rmd
===========================

This program shows how to open an Oracle database and count the number of records.

To open Oracle, you need to have a small text file stored with information about Oracle. For the purposes of this program, I have used a file called cdm_config.csv, but any name will do fine.

You can't peek at my file because it includes confidential information, but here is an example of what that file might look like.

account,password,access

GeorgeBrett,secret_password,//pointer_to_database_location

Make sure there is a line in the file .gitignore reading

cdm_config.csv

or your private password will be posted on a public repository.

```{r login_to_oracle}
library("ROracle")
cdm_config <- read.csv('../cdm_config.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
c_connect <-
  dbConnect(Oracle(), cdm_config$account, cdm_config$password, cdm_config$access)
dbListTables(c_connect)
dbGetQuery(c_connect, "select count(patient_num) from blueherondata.observation_fact")
```
