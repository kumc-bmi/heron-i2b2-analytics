## Abstract

Medical records are now stored electronically, allowing opportunities for research and quality improvement studies that did not exist before. In this talk, I will review the extraction of information into i2b2, a database that is scrubbed of personal identifiers, and will discuss the strengths and limitations of this data compared to other commonly used health care data sets. I will also show a simple example of creating a medical record phenotype and validating it against a tumor registry.

## Mining the EHR, the old way

![](~/heron-i2b2-analytics/bin/data-in-excel-spreadsheet.jpg)

## What is i2b2?

i2b2 is an acronym:

* Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside.

It has been adopted and aggressively promoted by many hospitals.

## What is i2b2?

It is an example of ETL:

* Extract,
* Transform, 
* Load.

## What is i2b2?

You cannot and should not analyze the EHR as it exists within Cerner and Epic because of

* privacy concerns,
* usability issues.

## What is i2b2?

Cerner and Epic are designed for the care needs of individual patients.

i2b2, in contrast, is designed for research.

* The data is de-identified.
* You can easily extract groups.
* You can integrate other data sets.

## What i2b2 lacks.

i2b2 does not include free text fields (patient notes).

i2b2 does not include information on health care provided to your patients, but provided at other locations.

## The EAV model

The i2b2 database uses a modified verison of the EAV model. EAV stands for

* Entity
* Attribute
* Value

Longitudinal data has two formats

* "tall and thin" and
* "short and fat".

The EAV model takes "tall and thin" to an extreme.

```{r eav-example, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
df1 <- data.frame(
  entity=c("alpha", "bravo"),
  a1=11:12,
  a2=21:22,
  a3=31:32,
  b1=c("a", "b"),
  b2=c("c", "d"),
  b3=c("e", "f"),
  d1=c("1-Jan", "2-Jan"),
  d2=c("1-Feb", "2-Feb"),
  d3=c("1-Mar", "2-Mar"),
  stringsAsFactors=FALSE
)

df2 <- data.frame(
  entity=c(rep("alpha", 5), "..."),
  attribute=c("a1", "b1", "d1", "a2", "b2", " "),
  value=c("11", "a", "1-Jan", "21", "c", " "),
  stringsAsFactors=FALSE
)  
```

## An example of a "short and fat" data set

`r kable(df1)`

## "Short and fat" transformed into the EAV model

`r kable(df2)`

## The EAV model

## Another example of the EAV model

```{r wikipedia-example}
# <pt XYZ>, <Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit>, "102"
# <pt XYZ>, <Presence of Cough>, "True"
# <pt XYZ>, <Type of Cough>, "With phlegm, streaks of blood"
# <pt XYZ>, <Heart Rate in beats per minute>, "98"
# ...

```

## Advantages

The advantages of the EAV structure are that

* you are only storing the medications, procedures, and diagnoses that a patient has,

* as new medications, procedures, and diagnoses appear, you can add these without altering the database structure.

The EAV structure is similar to that of a sparse matrix.

## The EAV model requires a lot of self-joins

Example: Get patients with breast cancer diagnosis...

```{r select-bc, echo=FALSE}
cat(
  "SELECT distinct patient_num",
  "  FROM observation_fact",
  "  WHERE concept_cd LIKE 'ICD10:C50%'",
sep="\n")
```

## The EAV model requires a lot of self-joins

Example: ...and restrict to females only...

```{r select-females-only, echo=FALSE}
cat(
  "SELECT distinct patient_num",
  "  FROM observation_fact",
  "  WHERE concept_cd = 'DEM|SEX:f'",
  "  JOIN (SELECT distinct patient_num AS bc_pt",
  "    FROM observation_fact",
  "    WHERE concept_cd LIKE 'ICD10:C50%')",
  "  ON patient_num=bc_pt",
sep="\n")
```

## The EAV model requires a lot of self-joins

Example: ...and get all medical procedures.

```{r select-procedures, echo=FALSE}
cat(
  "SELECT patient_num, concept_cd",
  "  FROM observation_fact",
  "  WHERE concept_cd LIKE 'CPT:%", 
  "  JOIN (SELECT distinct patient_num AS female_pt",
  "    FROM observation_fact",
  "    WHERE concept_cd = 'DEM|SEX:f')",
  "  ON patient_num=female_pt",
  "  JOIN (SELECT distinct patient_nm AS bc_pt",
  "    FROM observation_fact",
  "    WHERE concept_cd LIKE 'ICD10:C50%')",
  "  ON patient_num=bc_pt",
sep="\n")
```
