## Abstract

Medical records are now stored electronically, allowing opportunities for research and quality improvement studies that did not exist before. In this talk, I will review the extraction of information into i2b2, a database that is scrubbed of personal identifiers, and will discuss the strengths and limitations of this data compared to other commonly used health care data sets. I will also show a simple example of creating a medical record phenotype and validating it against a tumor registry.

## Mining the EHR, the old way

## What is i2b2?

i2b2 is an acronym:

* Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside.

It has been adopted and aggressively promoted by many hospitals.

## What is i2b2?

It is an example of ETL:

* Extract,
* Transform, 
* Load.

## What is i2b2?

You cannot and should not analyze the EHR as it exists within Cerner and Epic because of

* privacy concerns,
* usability issues.

## What is i2b2?

Cerner and Epic are designed for the care needs of individual patients.

i2b2, in contrast, is designed for research.

* The data is de-identified.
* You can easily extract groups.
* You can integrate other data sets.

## What i2b2 lacks.

i2b2 does not include free text fields (patient notes).

i2b2 does not include information on health care provided to your patients, but provided at other locations.
