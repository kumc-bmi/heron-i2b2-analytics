## Abstract

Medical records are now stored electronically, allowing opportunities for research and quality improvement studies that did not exist before. In this talk, I will review the extraction of information into i2b2, a database that is scrubbed of personal identifiers, and will discuss the strengths and limitations of this data compared to other commonly used health care data sets. I will also show a simple example of creating a medical record phenotype and validating it against a tumor registry.
